            Hi there I am developer, problem solver likes to code, develop
            applications on android and web. Recently I have shown interest on
            web applications, so for enhancing my skills on web development I am
            taking keen interest on it and started to develop few application
            one after another. Would you like to join me in this wonderful web
            development journey, as there are lot of exciting tasks and
            challenges yet to solve. You can join me at any time and shall
            proceed with web development and explore exciting challenges and

            travel with my family and sometimes with friends, my favourite place
            of visit is Shillong, Agartala. I have been to Delhi few times and
            explored electronics market out there is pretty interesting. However
            watching youtube videos on gaming consoles sold out in Delhi is very
            impressive, I bought ps2, psp from there. I had experienced game boy
            when I was in School. And I started to play pc games in desktop,
            exploring pc games were fun but playing games in ps4 was also very
            much overwhelming.
